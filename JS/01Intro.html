    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
    <p>JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.</p>
    <p>
      The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written
      right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
    </p>

    <p>
      The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual
      machine”.
    </p>
    <p>Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>V8 – in Chrome, Opera and Edge.</li>
      <li>SpiderMonkey – in Firefox.</li>
      <li>There are other codenames like “Chakra” for IE, “JavaScriptCore”,
        “Nitro” and “SquirrelFish” for Safari, etc.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>With the help of JavaScript we can manipulate HTML and CSS</p>
    <p>JavaScript is a Forgiving language</p>
    <p>JavaScript is a Synchronous Single Threaded Programming Language</p>
